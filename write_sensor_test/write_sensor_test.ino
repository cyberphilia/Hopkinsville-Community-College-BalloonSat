Based on BalloonSat Experiment Sensor Board Flight Code with some bug fixes

-------------------------------
 BalloonSat Experiment Sensor Board
 Flight Code
 Author: RadioBro Team
 Last Modified: March 17th, 2015
 Purpose: Read and Save Data from sensors on the BalloonSat Experiment Sensor Board. Detect launch and save data afterwards.
 PREFLIGHT: To access all memory locations, the onboard EEPROM must be overwritten to 0xFF (255) in all addresses before launch.
 Accomplish this with the EEPROM_CLEAR program.
 POSTFLIGHT: To recover saved data, use the RECOVERY program. Each byte will be printed on a seprate line.
 
 This was tested in Arduino 1.0.6 on March 17th, 2015 using BalloonSat Experiment Board Version P52520. Files MEMORY.CPP, MEMORY.h, MS5611.CPP, MS5611.h must be included in the same directory as this file to work.
 This code is open source and able to modified and redistributed freely.
